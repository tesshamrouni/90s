Nickelodeon
Everyone take a seat on the big orange couch, and beware of slime. Nickelodeon was the channel for kids (especially since back then the Disney Channel cost extra). We loved the animated shows like Rugrats, Hey Arnold, Doug, Ren and Stimpy, The Wild Thornberrys, and Ahh! Real Monsters. But then there were also shows like Hey Dude and Salute Your Shorts. And the game shows like Double Dare and Wild and Crazy Kids. You spent your Saturday nights watching All That and Are You Afraid of the Dark? And your summer afternoons with Stick Stickly (New York City, New York State, 10108!)

Girl Power Music
Whitney. Mariah. Celine. Alanis. Lauryn Hill. Jewel. Lisa Loeb. Tracy Chapman. Shania Twain. Dixie Chicks. TLC. Queen Latifah. Selena. Toni Braxton. Vanessa Williams. LeAnn Rimes. Faith Hill. These women were powerhouses. Top 10 hits, awards galore. And SO.MUCH.FEROCITY. Can we also remember that Cher staged an epic comeback and introduced us to autotune? Snaps, girlfriends.

Michael Jordan
Michael Jordan was the greatest basketball player of all time (sorry, LeBron). He had a hugely successful basketball career playing for the Chicago Bulls (No. 23 forever) then retired at the top of his game to play baseball. Luckily, he came back to the basketball court, wins more championships, and makes one of the best sports movies ever, Space Jam, when he saved the Looney Tunes from space aliens who stole the basketball talent of some of the best NBA players.

TGIF
No one wanted to go out on Friday nights in the ’90s. We all wanted to stay home and watch ABC’s TGIF (Thank God, It’s Friday). The lineup of mostly family-driven sitcoms is still such a huge part of pop culture that Hulu recently added all of the shows to their streaming service. How would we ever make it to Saturday without knowing what kind of shenanigans Steve Urkel was getting into? Or have Michelle Tanner say “You got it, dude!” You can probably sing the theme song to Step by Step. And we all wished we could have a teacher like Mr. Feeny. Personally, I still fantasize about having powers like Sabrina, the Teenage Witch.

Teen Television
Hanging out with the crew at The Max on Saved by the Bell, singing on the beach with the California Dreams, watching the latest Wakefield sister drama at Sweet Valley High, trying to decide if you were Popular, swooning over Jordan Catalano alongside Angela Chase on My So-Called Life, and watching Dawson’s Creek if only to fight with your friends about the merits of Dawson vs. Pacey. We were teens living the dream.

Pop Music
The resurgence of pure, 100% bubblegum pop of the late ’90s is probably one of the most memorable (and has long-lasting effects) parts of our lives. Starting with the Spice Girls and their in-your-face girl power, then spreading to boy bands like Hanson, Backstreet Boys, and *NSYNC. The decade also ushered in blonde divas, like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, and Mandy Moore.

Pokémon
Gotta catch ‘em all! Pokémon was all the rage, with kids collecting and trading cards faster than you can say Pikachu. They even got a full-length feature film in addition to their Saturday morning cartoon. Now that we’re adults, we play Pokémon Go! on our smartphones instead. But we still can’t catch ‘em all. Sorry, Ash.

Disney’s Renaissance
Technically, the Disney Renaissance began with The Little Mermaid in 1989, but ’90s kids have claimed Ariel as ours. Though it may have started in ‘89, it really made an impact in the ’90s. Beauty and the Beast was the first animated film to be nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award, and classics like Aladdin, The Lion King, Pocahontas, and Mulan are some of the best films, animated or not, ever.
If you’re feeling nostalgic, Scary Mommy has rounded up some of the most memorable and instantly iconic Disney quotes to scratch that itch. And while you’re going down this lane, enjoy some dirty Disney jokes that will destroy your childhood. Hey, we’re all adults now.


Rap Music
Many rap music fans will say that rap really peaked in the ’90s (I’m apt to agree.) The ’90s gave us some of the biggest and best rappers. Biggie Smalls and Tupac were LEGENDARY, and they were often caught up in the East Coast/West Coast rap wars. The ’90s also gave us Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Lil’ Kim, Foxy Brown, and Eminem.

Clever Marketing
Sure, the ’80s had “Where’s the Beef?” but we had “Wazzzzzup?” And you never wanted Taco Bell more than when you saw that cute little Chihuahua saying “Yo quiero Taco Bell.”

MTV
Yes, MTV was created in the ’80s, but it really became a cultural zeitgeist in the ’90s. MTV was one of the channels that made you jealous of your friends who had cable.
